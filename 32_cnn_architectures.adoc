LeNet is a classical CNN architecture in 1990s. It is used for handwritten digit classification. It has the following configuration:

The non-linearity in the output layer is the softmax function.

NOTE: The LeNet architecture is simple. Recent CNN architectures are far more sophisticated and complex.
